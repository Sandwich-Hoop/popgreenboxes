# popgreenboxes
C++ SFML game wherein you pop green boxes with WASD and SPACE. Bad.

----------------

This game exists as an executable and as an MSI only, this is because young ignorant me decided to build a version, save it, and reuse that same SFML setup because I couldn't be bothered making a new solution, meaning that the source code is lost.

<b>DOWNLOAD THE GAME BY VIEWING THE RAW FILE OF popgreenboxes/SH_popgreenboxes.exe <\b>
